## Summary about myself:

First and foremost, I love writing code. Ever since writing my first program in JavaScript, I have been obsessed of using software to create something global and useful. I believe in the power of programming to improve and totally transform the lives of people around the world.

For my first professional contact, I was working as a Trainee JS developer and later as a Junior JS developer. I have created web apps using React, Redux and NextJS. Also I was given the opportunity to work in a good team for interesting projects. Even when I left my work, I tend to continue writing code and learn new technologies. I like to play the piano, read many books, listening to music and meditate. All these little things help me to stay creative, organized and happy with my life and everything I do.

I am completely sure that my ability to work hard and passion to learn new technologies will help in my future career as a professional Frontend Developer. That is what keeps me up at night, a never ending thirst to create beautiful, powerful things and share them with the world.
