        <h2>Summary about myself</h2>
        <p>
          First and foremost, I love writing code. Ever since writing my first
          program in JavaScript, I have been obsessed of using software to
          create something global and useful. I believe in the power of
          programming to improve and totally transform the lives of people
          around the world.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          For my first professional contact, I was working as a Trainee JS
          developer and later as a Junior JS developer. I have created web apps
          using React, Redux and NextJS. Also I was given the opportunity to
          work in a good team for interesting projects. Even when I left my
          work, I tend to continue writing code and learn new technologies. I
          like to play the piano, read many books, listening to music and
          meditate. All these little things help me to stay creative, organized
          and happy with my life and everything I do.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I am completely sure that my ability to work hard and passion to learn
          new technologies will help in my future career as a professional
          Frontend Developer. That is what keeps me up at night, a never ending
          thirst to create beautiful, powerful things and share them with the
          world.
